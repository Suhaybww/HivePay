### **Testing the Complete Payment Process in Stripe's Test Mode**

Yes, it is entirely possible to **test your entire payment process**—from user registration and BECS Direct Debit setup to contribution collection, holding funds, payout execution, and handling edge cases—using Stripe's test mode. Stripe provides a robust testing environment that simulates real-world payment scenarios without processing actual funds. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you thoroughly test each component of your backend payment flow.

---

### **1. Understanding Stripe's Test Mode**

**Stripe Test Mode** allows developers to simulate transactions and test integrations without involving real money. This environment mirrors the live mode in functionality, enabling you to validate your backend logic effectively.

- **Toggle Test Mode:**
  - In your Stripe dashboard, ensure you're operating in **Test Mode**. All API keys and operations will be isolated from live data.

- **Test API Keys:**
  - Use **Test Secret Key** (`sk_test_...`) for server-side operations.
  - Use **Test Publishable Key** (`pk_test_...`) for client-side operations (though frontend is beyond this scope).

### **2. Setting Up and Testing User Registration and Onboarding**

#### **a. User Registration and Stripe Customer Creation**

**Objective:** Ensure that users can register, and corresponding Stripe Customer accounts are created successfully.

- **Process:**
  1. **Register a New User:**
     - Invoke your `authCallback` procedure to simulate user registration.
     - Verify that a new user record is created in your database with a unique `stripeCustomerId`.
  
  2. **Validate Stripe Customer Creation:**
     - Use Stripe's Dashboard or API to confirm that the Customer was created.
     - **API Verification:**
       ```javascript
       const customer = await stripe.customers.retrieve('cus_testcustomerid');
       console.log(customer);
       ```

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **Successful Registration:** User details are correctly stored, and a Stripe Customer is created.
  - **Duplicate Registration:** Attempt registering the same user again to ensure uniqueness constraints are enforced.
  - **Error Handling:** Simulate failures (e.g., network issues) and verify that appropriate error messages are returned and logged.

#### **b. BECS Direct Debit Setup**

**Objective:** Validate that users can set up BECS Direct Debit correctly.

- **Process:**
  1. **Initiate BECS Setup:**
     - Call the `setupBECSDirectDebit` mutation for a registered user.
  
  2. **Create Test Payment Method:**
     - Use Stripe's test bank account details to create a BECS payment method.
       ```javascript
       const paymentMethod = await stripe.paymentMethods.create({
         type: 'au_becs_debit',
         au_becs_debit: {
           bsb_number: '123456',
           account_number: '000000000',
         },
         billing_details: {
           name: 'Test User',
           email: 'test.user@example.com',
         },
       });
       ```
  
  3. **Confirm SetupIntent:**
     - Use the `client_secret` from the SetupIntent to confirm the setup (this step is typically handled on the client side, but ensure your backend can handle the confirmation process).
  
  4. **Verify BECS Setup Completion:**
     - Check that `stripeBecsPaymentMethodId` and `stripeMandateId` are correctly stored in the user's database record.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **Successful Setup:** BECS Direct Debit is set up without issues.
  - **Invalid Bank Details:** Use incorrect BSB or account numbers to simulate setup failures.
  - **Partial Setup Completion:** Simulate scenarios where only part of the setup process completes to test data consistency.

#### **c. Stripe Connect Express Account Creation**

**Objective:** Ensure that users can create Stripe Connect Express accounts to receive payouts.

- **Process:**
  1. **Invoke `createStripeConnectAccount`:**
     - Call this mutation for a registered user.
  
  2. **Generate Account Links:**
     - Verify that the returned `accountLink.url` directs to Stripe's onboarding flow.
  
  3. **Simulate Onboarding Completion:**
     - Use Stripe CLI or manually adjust the account status in the test dashboard to mimic completed onboarding.
  
  4. **Verify Account Status:**
     - Ensure that `onboardingStatus` is updated to `Completed` in your database.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **Successful Onboarding:** User completes the Stripe Connect onboarding successfully.
  - **Failed Onboarding:** Simulate failures during onboarding and verify that `onboardingStatus` is set to `Failed`.
  - **Re-Onboarding:** Attempt to recreate or update Stripe Connect accounts for users who have previously failed onboarding.

- **Process:**
  1. **Prepare Group Data:**
     - Ensure that a group exists with defined `contributionAmount`, `contributionFrequency`, and `groupMemberships` each having a valid BECS payment method.
  
  2. **Invoke `startContributionCycle`:**
     - Trigger this mutation with the relevant `groupId`, `scheduleDate`, and `payoutDate`.
  
  3. **Create PaymentIntents:**
     - Verify that PaymentIntents are created for each group member using their `stripeCustomerId` and BECS `PaymentMethod`.
  
  4. **Store Payment Records:**
     - Ensure that each PaymentIntent ID is correctly stored in the `Payment` model with `status` set to `Pending`.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **All Payments Succeed:** Simulate successful PaymentIntents and verify status updates via webhooks.
  - **Partial Failures:** Introduce failures for some PaymentIntents and observe how the system handles retries and status updates.
  - **No Payment Methods:** Attempt to start a contribution cycle for a group member without a BECS payment method and ensure appropriate error handling.

#### **b. Monitoring PaymentIntents via Webhooks**

**Objective:** Ensure that your system correctly processes webhook events related to PaymentIntents.

### **4. Holding Funds Temporarily**

**Objective:** Validate that funds are held appropriately during the settlement period and that your system correctly flags successful and failed payments.

- **Process:**
  1. **Simulate Settlement Period:**
     - Since Stripe's test mode does not enforce actual waiting periods, simulate the 3-5 business days by manipulating your backend's scheduling logic or using time-mocking libraries in tests.
  
  2. **Flagging Payments:**
     - Upon receiving `payment_intent.succeeded`, ensure that the corresponding `Payment` record is flagged as `Successful`.
     - Upon receiving `payment_intent.payment_failed`, trigger retry logic or mark as `Failed`.
  
  3. **Implement Settlement Logic:**
     - Develop backend procedures to handle the settlement status post the simulated period, ensuring funds are either held or marked for refunds as necessary.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **Settlement Success:** Payments are successfully settled, and funds are flagged appropriately.
  - **Settlement Failure:** Payments fail during settlement, triggering retries or refunds.
  - **Delayed Settlement:** Simulate delays and verify that timeout logic is correctly invoked after the settlement period.

     - Verify that all `Payment` records for the cycle are marked as `Successful`.
  
  2. **Identify Next Payout Recipient:**
     - Determine the next user in the payout rotation based on your logic (e.g., `payoutOrder`).
  
  3. **Calculate Total Contribution Amount:**
     - Sum the `amount` from all `Payment` records to determine the payout `amount`.
  
  4. **Create Transfer via Stripe API:**
     - Invoke Stripe's `transfers.create` to move funds to the recipient's Stripe Connect account.
       ```javascript
       const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
         amount: Math.round(totalAmount * 100), // in cents
         currency: 'aud',
         destination: stripeAccountId,
         metadata: {
           groupId,
           userId: recipientUserId,
         },
       });
       ```
  
  5. **Update Database Records:**
     - Create a new `Payout` record with `status` set to `Completed`.
     - Log the transaction in the `Transaction` model.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - **Successful Payout:** Funds are successfully transferred, and database records are updated accordingly.
  - **Payout Failure:** Simulate transfer failures (e.g., invalid `stripeAccountId`) and verify that `Payout.status` is set to `Failed` and appropriate notifications are triggered.
  - **Insufficient Funds:** Although test mode may not enforce actual balance checks, simulate scenarios where funds are insufficient to trigger error handling.
