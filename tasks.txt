     - Comprehensive models (`User`, `Plan`, `Subscription`, `Group`, `GroupMembership`, `Payment`, `Payout`, `Transaction`) with relevant fields and relationships.
     - Enums for various statuses and types (`ContractStatus`, `SubscriptionStatus`, `PayoutOrderMethod`, `MembershipStatus`, `PayoutStatus`, `PaymentStatus`, `TransactionType`, `Gender`, `Frequency`, `OnboardingStatus`, `BECSSetupStatus`, `TicketStatus`, `TicketPriority`) to ensure data consistency.

2. **User Registration and Onboarding:**
   - **Authentication and User Creation:**
     - `authCallback`: Handles user authentication via Kinde, creating or updating user records in the database.
   - **User Details Management:**
     - `updateUserDetails`: Allows users to update personal information such as phone number, age, and gender.
   - **Stripe Connect Account Creation:**
     - `createStripeConnectAccount`: Facilitates the creation of Stripe Connect Express accounts for users, updating their records with `stripeAccountId` and generating account onboarding links.

3. **BECS Direct Debit Setup:**
   - **Setup Process:**
     - `setupBECSDirectDebit`: Manages the creation of Stripe customers (if not existing), initiates SetupIntents for BECS Direct Debit, and updates user records with relevant BECS details.

4. **Contribution Collection:**
   - **Starting Contribution Cycles:**
     - `startContributionCycle`: Initiates payment cycles by creating PaymentIntents for each group member, ensuring that each member has a BECS payment method set up, and records payment details in the database.

5. **Payout Execution:**
   - **Processing Payouts:**
     - `processPayout`: Transfers collected funds to the next user in the rotation, updates payout and transaction records, and verifies fund availability in connected accounts.

6. **Webhook Handling:**
   - **Stripe Webhooks:**
     - Handles a variety of Stripe webhook events, including:
       - `checkout.session.completed`
       - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
       - `customer.subscription.deleted`
       - `setup_intent.succeeded`
       - `payment_intent.succeeded`
       - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
       - `payment_intent.processing`
       - `account.updated`
       - `account.application.deauthorized`
       - `capability.updated`
       - `transfer.reversed`
     - Updates user subscriptions, payment statuses, BECS setup statuses, and handles account and transfer-related events appropriately.
